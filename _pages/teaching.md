Teaching has been a rewarding and consistent part of my academic journey, from lab instruction to specialized machine learning courses and summer schools.

At the University of Crete, I served as a teaching assistant for several undergraduate physics labs, including Optics, Electricity, and Advanced Physics Lab I, where I guided students through experimental techniques, data analysis, and scientific reporting.

More recently, I was a TA for the “Introduction to Data Science and Machine Learning” course, where I designed hands-on sessions and weekly assignments covering topics from linear regression to convolutional neural networks. I also gave in-class mini-lectures summarizing theoretical foundations, helping bridge the gap between abstract concepts and practical implementations.

In Summer 2024, I was a lecturer at the [Astrostatistics Summer School in Crete](https://astro.physics.uoc.gr/Conferences/Astrostatistics_School_Crete_2024/), where I taught modules on Bayesian statistics, MCMC, deep learning, and simulation-based inference. I prepared and delivered lectures, as well as interactive Jupyter tutorials (available [here](https://github.com/astrostatistics-in-crete/2024_summer_school)).
I will return as a lecturer at the [2025 edition](https://astro.physics.uoc.gr/Conferences/Astrostatistics_School_Crete_2025/) of the Astrostatistics Summer School in Crete, continuing to teach and expand on topics at the intersection of astrophysics and modern statistical inference.
